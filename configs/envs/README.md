# Environment Notes

- `macos-x86_64-python38.yml` (coming soon): Conda environment for Rosetta 2 / Turi Create.
- `macos-arm64-python311.yml` (coming soon): Native arm64 environment for the PyTorch/Core ML Tools upgrade path.

Document platform-specific quirks (e.g., `CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64`) here as the project evolves.
