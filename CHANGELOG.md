## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

#### Runtime Engine
```python
# Old way (0.1.0)
from src.runtime import RuntimeEngine
engine = RuntimeEngine()
result = engine.run(text, image)

# New way (0.2.0)
from src.runtime.engine import RuntimeEngine
engine = RuntimeEngine(model_paths=paths)
await engine.initialize()
result = await engine.run_text_encoder(input_ids, attention_mask)
```

#### Configuration
```yaml
# Old way (0.1.0)
model:
  text_encoder: "bert-base-uncased"
  image_encoder: "ViT-B-32"

# New way (0.2.0)
models:
  text_encoder:
    model_name: "bert-base-uncased"
    max_length: 512
  image_encoder:
    model_name: "ViT-B-32"
    image_size: 224
```

#### Android Development
```kotlin
// Old way (0.1.0)
class EditJudgeActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    // Basic implementation
}

// New way (0.2.0)
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    // Jetpack Compose implementation
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContent {
            EditJudgeTheme {
                EditJudgeApp()
